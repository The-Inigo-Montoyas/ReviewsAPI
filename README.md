# Agile Creations Reviews API

For this project I worked with a team of engineers on the systems design of an eccomerce platform. I was given the legacy code base for the front end to this platform, and I was required to design the schema, create the server/database, and migrate millions of lines of data into the new database, and then deploy and scale it to handle production level traffic.

I was responsible for the reviews section of this platform, in which users have the ability to review a product or search reviews about a product.
